DESCRIPTION
___________________________________________________

This is a simple program for editing and querying a csv file table containing information about various records.

I originally developed this program in the summer of 2019 to create an inventory of my Dad's record collection, but gradually
added functionality for querying the collection as well. 

The list of records attached with this program is only a subset of the records in my Dad's collection.

Note: A mySQL version of this program exists in the same repository within 'RecordListManagerDB'

DEPENDENCIES

This program was developed using Python3 and makes use of a lambda function.

The csv library is used for this project.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
___________________________________________________

This program can be run with the command 'python recordMenu.py' and will ask if you want to load a list from a file or create a new one.
Afterwards, you can use the edit or query menu commands to manipulate the Records table.
